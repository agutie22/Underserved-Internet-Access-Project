## Purpose:

## How to use our github
Our github contains a pdf of our presentation which details what we wanted to do and what we were able to do
* Our project uses two datasets, one can be found directly on the github, the other one which we used for mapping is much larger so please visit the following:

* for our mapping using geopandas, the "Shapefile" is what we downloaded because it contains location information the csv file does not have

Our code extracts the "Shapefile" directly from the website and opens it into Google Colab, however if you want to download the zip folder onto your computer, you can then upload it into Google Colab
with the following:
